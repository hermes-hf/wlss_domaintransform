In the folder symbolic_solutions, we provide python notebooks that provide the analytical formulas used in the paper, both for the barrier problem, and the plateau problem.

In application/source we provide the source code used, at the application/notebooks we show an example of filtered images comparison.

The application/data folder is empty, the code expects the images to be placed at this folder.

Our numerical experiments were executed using the application/experiments.py script
